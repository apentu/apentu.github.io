    Apentu provides temporary recruitment agencies with a powerful competitive advantage. 
  - >
    Apentu collects the availability of your temps at a time to suit them, and delivers it to your consultants at a time to suit you. 
  - >
    Apentu only works out of hours, to ensure that your availibility is more up to date than your competitors- so you can start the day one step ahead of the competition.

    Best of all, the process is entirely automated and self-managing. So your consultants can spend more time on business development, less time doing repetitive tasks.
